        <p>Tulumba is a popular dessert found in the cuisines of the former Ottoman Empire. It is a fried pastry soaked in syrup.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups water</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>3 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
            <li>5 large eggs</li>
            <li>2 cups vegetable oil for frying</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Syrup:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>5 cups white sugar</li>
            <li>2 ½ cups water</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring 2 cups of water and 6 tablespoons oil to a boil in a large pot over high heat. Remove from heat and stir in flour and baking powder until well combined. Allow to cool, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>While syrup cools, heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Spoon dough into a tulumba syringe or an icing bag with a special nozzle and pipe small portions of dough into the hot oil. You can also drop spoonfuls of dough into the hot oil, but then the tulumbas won't have the traditional shape. Work in batches and fry tulumbas until golden, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate. Let cool, about 10 minutes. Transfer tulumbas to a bowl and pour cooled syrup on top. Allow to soak for at least 2 hours.</li>
        </ol>
